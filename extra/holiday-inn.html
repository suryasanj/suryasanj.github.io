      <section>

        <p>Thanks for being there for all of us through our highs and lows.</p>

        <p>We all have a thing or two to learn from your resilience, dealing
        with ðŸ˜‘ and a shoulder injury. You teach us about new things every day,
        and you show us how to be resourceful even when resourcefulness isnâ€™t
        even needed! (More specifically, automatic picture-taking when your
        camera detects a smile). And more than anything else, your ability to
        turn any conversation into a light-hearted one brings laughs when they
        are most needed.</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 1500px">We all love you!</p>

        <p>Wait one moment.</p>

        <p>You donâ€™t actually think we forgot to buy you a gift, do you?</p>

        <p>Hint: check underneath the chair in the futon room closest to the
        stairs.</p>
