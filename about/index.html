	    vague questions about myself to the best of my ability.
	    I intend this as a more personal complement to the information

        <h2>Who are you?</h2>
	<h3>My Name</h3>
	<p>
	My name is Surya Sanjay, and I accept three pronunciations of my name:
	an Indianized [ˈsuːɾja(ː) ˈsʌnd͡ʒɛɪ̯], an Americanized [ˈsɝjə ˈsɑnd͡ʒej],
	and a hybrid [ˈsuːɹjə ˈsənd͡ʒej].<!--
	--><label for="ipa" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="ipa" class="margin-toggle" />
            <span class="sidenote">
	        If you’re not a linguist and these symbols look unfamiliar to you,
		these phonetic notations are transcribed using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet"
		style="font-variant: small-caps">
		ipa
		</a> (the International Phonetic Alphabet, not India Pale Ale).
	    </span>
	My family uses a patronymic surname convention, meaning everyone’s legal
	last name is their father’s first.
	We may have had a family name generations ago, but, even if we did, no one remembers it.
	</p>
	<p>
	My legal name is short for my ‘religious name,’ Sūryanārāyaṇá.
	</p>
	<h3>My Ancestry</h3>
	<p>
	My parents emigrated to the United States from Tamil Nadu, the southernmost state in India.
	Whereas both my parents grew up in relatively large towns in the state, I can trace my lineage back to
	at least three places: Namandi (<span class="tam">நமண்டி</span>), Tiruvarur (<span class="tam">திருவாரூர்</span>), and southern regions in the state of Andhra Pradesh.
	</p>
	<p>
	My mother tongue is Tamil, a language, which is often erroneously termed the ‘oldest language in the world’<!--
	--><label for="tamil" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="tamil" class="margin-toggle" />
            <span class="sidenote">
                When you deliberate on the phrase ‘oldest language in the world,’ you
		realize that that phrase means nothing at all. Languages evolve over time,
		so it’s misguided, at best, to say that Tamil spoken in 100 <span style="font-variant: small-caps">bce</span>
		is the same language as Tamil spoken now.
		Even then, we have records of many other languages that predate the earliest records of Tamil.
	    </span>
	albeit having a continuous 2.5-millennium written record. 
	I’m fluent in Tamil, although some tell me the way I speak is bookish.

        <h2>When are you?</h2>
	<p>I was born in 2003, and I remember some of the most influential technological revolutions,
	most notably that of the smartphone and that of artificial intelligence, which is underway
	as I write this.</p>
	<p>As such, I also have a soft spot for movies and music (western and Indian) created in the 
	early 2000s. Much of my design style is influenced by early-2000s attempts to apply 20<sup>th</sup>-century
	minimalist typography to web development.</p>
