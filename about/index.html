	    vague questions about myself to the best of my ability.
	    I intend this as a more personal complement to the information

	    However, nothing can beat getting to know someone through conversation,
	    so if you have any questions, research ideas, or fun things to discuss,

        <h2>Who are you?</h2>
	<h3>My Name</h3>
	<p>
	My name is Surya Sanjay, and I accept three pronunciations of my name:
	an Indianized [ˈsuːɾja(ː) ˈsʌnd͡ʒɛɪ̯], an Americanized [ˈsɝjə ˈsɑnd͡ʒej],
	and a hybrid [ˈsuːɹjə ˈsənd͡ʒej].<!--
	--><label for="ipa" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="ipa" class="margin-toggle" />
            <span class="sidenote">
	        If you’re not a linguist and these symbols look unfamiliar to you,
		these phonetic notations are transcribed using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet"
		style="font-variant: small-caps">
		ipa
		</a> (the International Phonetic Alphabet, not India Pale Ale).
	    </span>
	My family uses a patronymic surname convention, meaning everyone’s legal
	last name is their father’s first.
	We may have had a family name generations ago, but, even if we did, no one remembers it.
	</p>
	<p>
	My legal name is short for my ‘religious name,’ Sūryanārāyaṇá.
	</p>
	<h3>My Ancestry</h3>
	<p>
	My parents emigrated to the United States from Tamil Nadu, the southernmost state in India.
	Whereas both my parents grew up in relatively large towns in the state, I can trace my lineage back to
	at least three places: Namandi (<span class="tam">நமண்டி</span>), Tiruvarur (<span class="tam">திருவாரூர்</span>), and southern regions in the state of Andhra Pradesh.
	</p>
	<p>
	My mother tongue is Tamil, a language, which is often erroneously termed the ‘oldest language in the world’<!--
	--><label for="tamil" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="tamil" class="margin-toggle" />
            <span class="sidenote">
                When you deliberate on the phrase ‘oldest language in the world,’ you
		realize that that phrase means nothing at all. Languages evolve over time,
		so it’s misguided, at best, to say that Tamil spoken in 100 <span style="font-variant: small-caps">bce</span>
		is the same language as Tamil spoken now.
		Even then, we have records of many other languages that predate the earliest records of Tamil.
	    </span>
	albeit having a continuous 2.5-millennium written record. 
	I’m fluent in Tamil, although some tell me the way I speak is bookish.

        <h2>What are you?</h2>
	<p>Human. I don’t know how else to answer this question 😃.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>When are you?</h2>
	<p>Hopefully I exist at the same time as you... don’t want any rifts in teh space-time continuum.</p>
	<p>I was born in 2003, and I remember some of the most influential technological revolutions,
	most notably that of the smartphone and that of artificial intelligence, which is underway
	as I write this. Much of my worldview is influenced by popular culture from this time.</p>
	<p>As such, I also have a soft spot for movies and music (western and Indian) created in the 
	early 2000s. Much of my design style is influenced by early-2000s attempts to apply 20ᵗʰ-century
	minimalist typography to the then-new web.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Where are you?</h2>
	<p>I live in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as I attend the University of Michigan. I was born and raised in Michigan,
	and I love the scenery and culture of the state.</p>
	<p>I’ve also travelled to the Caribbean (The Bahamas); Europe (The United Kingdom, France, Spain, Italy, and Germany);
	and Asia (India, Sri Lanka, and China).
	Though I like both, I’d choose mountains over beaches.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why are you?</h2>
	<p>I gain immense satisfaction out of solving technical problems and personal connections.
	I live to provide tailored care for others through a specialized knowledge of medicine and, on a broader scale, by innovating
	on the existing standard of care.
