        I like finding order in things; and when it’s not already there, I
        like to create order. However, my antipathy towards disorder doesn’t
        stem from a lack of familiarity or difficulty to process something
        without order. Rather, it’s when the disorder magnifies to a level where
        it has a palpable impact on efficiency that I have a strong urge to fix
        it.
        </p>

        <p>
        I’ll make the abstraction clearer with an example. I decided to
        change the font that I use in <code>Terminal.app</code>, MacOS’s
        shell.<label for="term-expl" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="term-expl" class="margin-toggle" />
          <span class="sidenote">
            For those who don’t know what a shell is, worry not. It’ll be useful
            in a <a href="#shell">later section</a> of this post, and I’ll explain when it’s
            necessary.
          </span>
        I had four requirements: (1) aesthetics, (2) readability, (3) diacritic
        support,<label for="diac-expl" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="diac-expl" class="margin-toggle" />
          <span class="sidenote">
            This has no relevance to the post, but here’s a <a
            href="https://www.thesaurus.com/e/grammar/diacritical-marks/">link</a>
            to an explanation. Essentially, it’s a mark that can be added to
            letters to change the sound they make. For the linguistics research
            I do, it’s extremely necessary for a font to be able to support
            this.
          </span>
        and (4) a plethora of icons. Aesthetics and readability were the least
        limiting criteria–there are lots of options for good monospace (i.e.
        coding) fonts that look good. Having lots of icons, surprisingly, was
        not that big of an issue, because the GitHub repo <code><a
        href="https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts">nerd-fonts</a></code> has
        a full list of them with the added capability of patching an existing
        font with extra symbols. The hardest part turned out to be finding a
        font with good diacritic support: I found one, but it fulfilled none of
        the other categories. So then why not compromise? Qualities (1), (3) and
        (4), in fact, are all contributors to readability, and anything that
        compromises readability slows down my coding. So, I went out of my way
        to find a really handy
        <a href="https://typeof.net/Iosevka/">tool</a> to add diacritic support
        to an aesthetic and readable font, and I used the patcher to add icons.
        In essence, I created a new font:<label for="code-expl" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="code-expl" class="margin-toggle" />
          <span class="sidenote">
            A simple <code>bash</code> script for cancelling processes on a
            (Slurm-managed) supercomputer. I included the Tamil text (“job # ...
            is finished”) and icons to demonstrate diacritic and icon support.
          </span>

        Whereas this example is relatively trivial, optimizing the other various
        aspects of life can have a drastic impact on how much time you spend on
        them. This post will focus on optimizing one major process, which I will
        call the <i>synthése</i>:<label for="syn-expl" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="syn-expl" class="margin-toggle" />
          <span class="sidenote">
            There very likely is a word for this. I and ChatGPT are working
            together to try and figure that out at the moment.

        <h2>Why Invest in a Productivity System?</h2>

        <p>
        I don’t believe in a one-size-fits-all model that some YouTubers
        push for.<label for="syn-expl" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="syn-expl" class="margin-toggle" />
          <span class="sidenote">
            Don’t get me wrong–I really respect <a href="aliabdaal.com">Ali
            Abdaal</a> and other content creators out there for providing helpful tips
            to the masses. I used to follow their advice, but as time
            progressed, the more and more I realized that I needed a system that
            worked specifically for me and my interests.
          </span>
        I believe each person has a system that fits their own needs. This post
        will present a model and only as a model to inspire new models.
        </p>

        <p><span class="newthought">That aside,</span>
        everyone utilizes the synthése in one way, shape, or form. The
        information being processed and the ideas and projects that result,
        however, are what differ from person to person. For a film director, the
        information processed might be the critiques of their old films and
        outputted ideas may represent new ways to shot a scene. For a
        researcher, on the other hand, the information may be journal articles
        and the outputted ideas new experiments. 
        </p>

        <p>A productivity system relies on a very simple principle: let a
        machine do something for you, so you can invest your brain power in
        other places. So, a productivity system for a synthése would store
        information and ideas in a meaningful manner and automate any
        processes in between when possible. As an example of the latter, one
        friend of mine was trying to transfer all of her MS Word citations to
        Zotero, a bibliography management tool, and she was doing it <i>by
        hand</i>. She’d approached me for an unrelated question, but when I
        noticed this, I recommended she use ChatGPT to convert her citations to
        <a href="www.bibtex.org">BibTeX</a> and import that file directly into
        Zotero. A process that would’ve taken two hours was shortened to a span
        of fifteen minutes.
        </p>

        <p>The question everyone must ask themselves before optimizing their
        synthése, then, is whether it is worth it. Depending on the needs of the
        synthése, the investment required for optimization might outweight the
        gained productivity. Further, some may be fully optimized and happy just
        using their brains.<label for="use-brains" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="use-brains" class="margin-toggle" />
          <span class="sidenote">
            Definitely could not be me. But if that’s you, please reach out. I
            want to learn how to do that.

        <h2>Information Storage</h2>

        <p>The main crux at this stage is to separate the useful content from
        the useless and place it in a location that’s convenient to access.</p>

        <p>The main content that I digest is news articles and journal articles,
        the latter mainly focusing on clinical research, bioinformatics, and
        sporadically some basic science studies. I start by signing up for mail
        notifications when new articles appear, so they show up in my inbox.
        This way, I don’t have to remember to check for them. I have a <a
        href="https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9282734?hl=en">macro</a>
        that automatically labels them as ‘Reading’ and categorizes them in a
        separate folder in my inbox.</p>

        <p>Then, whenever I check my email, I check to see which articles are
        interesting within those feeds.<label for="nature" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="nature" class="margin-toggle">
          <span class="marginnote">
            <img src="../../img/nature.png" alt="My Nature Feed">
            <b>My Feed from the Journal <i>Nature</i></b>. Today, I found the article
            on AlphaFold3, a protein structure prediction model, the most
            interesting.
          </span>
        Next comes the largest challenge: I don’t have time to read all the
        time, but I’d like to be able to read some articles later. News apps
        already do this for you by keeping (and curating) a feed, but mixing uninteresting
        articles with interesting articles in your email inbox, as well as
        emails about others things, is a recipe for failure.</p>

        <p>The best way around this–I’ve found–is to use a ‘read-it-later’ app,
        which stores article text and metadata in a feed, so you can–guess
        what–read it later. The app I use for this is <a
          href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instapaper">Instapaper</a>, which
        works like a wonder, embedded with various useful features, like
        annotation, AI summaries, and speed reading.

      <section>

        <h2>Information Processing</h2>

        <p>This is, by far, the most important aspect of my synthése system, and
        it is where most of the divergence from conventional productivity
        systems has taken place. To describe it entirely would take a few other
        blog posts, so I will keep it brief.</p>

        <p id="shell"><span class="newthought">Much of my computer work</span> is
        restricted to the shell, which is a bare-bones way to interact with your
        computer’s operating system without a fancy visualization. This is
        mainly because much of my research work is done on remote
        (super)computers, which don’t have GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces), and
        thus require me to use the shell. To edit text remotely, I use Vim, a
        text-processing software that you either hate or love. Being in the
        second category, I use Vim for absolutely everything: coding, taking notes, my
        to-do list, so on and so forth. Since Vim is not accessible through your
        cell phone,<label
          for="termius" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="termius" class="margin-toggle" />
          <span class="sidenote">
            Technically it can be, by using an app called Termius and remotely
            logging into your laptop. I would recommend against this for
            something as trivial as accessing your to-do list.
          </span>
        for about six months of my life, the only way to access my to-do list
        was through my laptop. And, while that was somewhat refreshing, it
        turned out to be a burden.
        </p>

        <p>For taking notes and for my tasklist on Vim, I’d already been using a
        plugin called <code><a href="https://vimwiki.github.io">vimwiki</a></code>, which, amongst other things, allows
        you to navigate between notes files very quickly. <code>vimwiki</code>
        makes use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>
        files, which employ a very simple language that is used as a backend to
        render user-facing variants of some webpages and apps.</p>

        <p>In order to sync with my phone, I needed to find an app that would
        both make use of Markdown files and store these files on cloud.
        Surprisingly, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/obsidian">Obsidian</a>
        filled that role perfectly. The only caveat is that the cloud sync
        feature that they offer is a subscription feature only. However, I found
        a loophole, which is that Obsidian files are anyway stored on iCloud,
        meaning that they must be in some directory on my MacBook. They were (in
        the most random folder). With that, I could view my notes and to-do list
        on all my Apple devices.</p>

        <p><span class="newthought">But the benefits of Obsidian</span> are not
        limited to just that. Obsidian integrates seamlessly with Instapaper,
        neatly storing and organizing notes into directories within your notes
        folder, making them very conveniently accessible. Not only that, the
        notes are organized next to the excerpts of text they highlight, with
        clickable links to locations within the article.<label for="obsidian" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="obsidian" class="margin-toggle">
          <span class="marginnote">
            <img src="../../img/obsidian.png" alt="Obsidian-Instapaper Integration">
            <b>Obsidian-Instapaper Integration</b>. Notes and article snippets
            are organized exactly how I need them to be.
          </span>
        </p>

        <p>Obsidian makes use of something called the <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/overview/">Zettelkasten</a>
        system, which organizes notes into three categories: fleeting,
        literature, and permanent. My system is similar, with one large
        <code>temp</code> folder which contains unorganized notes until later
        review, a <code>ref</code> folder which directly imports from
        Instapaper, and an <code>ideas</code> folder which stores project ideas.
        The main difference between my system and Zettelkasten is that, in
        Zettelkasten, all ideas must derive from <code>temp</code>. In my
        system, <code>temp</code> is just for storage. <code>ideas</code> is the
        only important folder. Both can be edited without being informed by the
        other and can be totally mutually exclusive.</p>

        <p>The benefit of using a shell with Obsidian is the ability to edit
        files quickly and search quickly, which would otherwise be difficult
        with a GUI. Especially with a <code>ref</code> folder that fills up with
        tons of useful articles that I sadly don’t remember, this is a must.</p>

        <h2>Ideation, Project Management, & Presentation</h2>

        <p>Ideation is the simplest part to automate, as no automation is
        necessary. We automated the rest of the system so that ideation could
        take up the majority of the work.</p>

        <p>But there’s more to mention at this step: once you choose an idea to
        work on, how do you optimize that process? I’ve tried and tested many
        to-do list systems, and while mine might not be the most efficient, it
        has stood the test of time for me. I use <code>vimwiki</code> for my
        to-do list, and I simply organize each entry by due date, and further by
        what project or class it is for. The important thing here is the method
        by which I organize it, not the app I use: I put <i>everything</i> that
        has a due date in my life–personal or professional–and organizing it all
        on one page affords me with an impetus to get things done ahead of time.</p>

        <p><span class="newthought">Presenting the results of projects</span> is something that may also be
        automated. Fortunately or unfortunately, restrictions are placed on how
        we can present things: we have to somehow simultaneously maximize
        content, aesthetics, and guidelines given by the forum we’re presenting
        in and the field we’re a part of.<label for="illinois" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="illinois" class="margin-toggle" />
          <span class="sidenote">
            This is loosely adapted from the <a href="http://www.theillinoismodel.com/p/what-is-illinois-model.html">Illinois model</a>.
          </span>
        </p>

        <p>When we’re given a strict format, whether we like how it looks or
        not, it is optimized, because there is no decision-making to be made
        aside from the content that needs to be presented. It is surprisingly
        the open-ended formats that affect the time taken to compose a document
        or presentation, because we have to take the time to <i>de novo</i>
        create a fitting aesthetic.</p>

        <p>I used to create a new aesthetic each time, until I discovered MS
        Word and PowerPoint templates during my freshman year of college.
        However, Microsoft Office tools, though very versatile, are sometimes
        very clunky to use and don’t offer full customizability. So, I turned to
        the beast: $\rm{\LaTeX}$.<label for="latex" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="latex" class="margin-toggle" />
          <span class="sidenote">
            $\rm{\LaTeX}$ is a powerful text-processing tool, which basically
            allows you to code text. In my opinion, there are two uses for
            $\rm{\LaTeX}$: (1) you use a lot of complex equations or chemical
            diagrams in your documents, and (2) you use the same formatting
            in all of your documents. If you fit into either category, I
            encourage you to try it out <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Free_online_introduction_to_LaTeX_(part_1)">
            here</a>.
          </span>
        </p>

        <p>$\rm{\LaTeX}$ is great, and it allowed me to create templates for
        every type of document I could think of. Not to mention, there is great
        integration between Vim and <code><a href="https://github.com/lervag/vimtex">vimtex</a></code> (check out
        Elijan Mastnak’s great tutorial <a href="https://ejmastnak.com/tutorials/vim-latex/intro/">here</a>)
        that make its speed rival and, perhaps, surpass Microsoft Office.
        But I found myself customizing
        so much that the benefits didn’t outweigh the time invested into
        creating templates for myself...</p>

        <p><span class="newthought">Recently, I discovered the writings of
          Edward Tufte</span>, a man known for
        his work in data visualization and presentation. He’s famous for his
        <a href="https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/pi/2016_2017/phil/tufte-powerpoint.pdf">complete roast</a>
        on using slides. Though I believe his ideas on slides to be outdated,<label for="latex" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="latex" class="margin-toggle" />
          <span class="sidenote">
            There have been clear improvements in slideshow design since 2003,
            when he wrote his article (see below–image accessed from Tufte 2003). I agree with him that
            slides are not used the way they should be, though.
            <img src="../../img/tufte_ppt.png" alt="My Nature Feed"
            style="margin-top: 10px">
          </span>
        his indefatigable use of handouts inspired me. His design aesthetic and
        attention to detail (which inspired this website!) also intrigued me,
        and I’ve adapted it to my own liking. Luckily, there are $\rm{\LaTeX}$
        templates that follow his style, so they didn’t require much
        modification.

        <p>So, my optimal presentation strategy fell into place, partly due to
        the influence of a critique of Tufte’s article.<label for="doumont" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="doumont" class="margin-toggle" />
          <span class="sidenote">
            Doumont 2005. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43089160"><i>The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint: Slides Are Not
                All Evil.</i></a>
          </span>
        For any project, the most basic concrete deliverable is a presentation,
        in order to communicate findings. Presentations should be concise,
        however, to keep the attention of a tired and yawning audience, so
        information can only be included selectively in a presentation. Even
        less should be included in slides.</p>

        <p>
        Whereas some presentations lead to
        write-ups or publications, others don’t warrant them. However, there is
        a need to completely document the project, both in order to properly
        prepare talking points for a presentation, and to allow interested
        audience members a further read. And the handout fills that role.
        </p>

        <p>How, then, do we differentiate the use of a slideshow and that of a
        handout? My recommendation is to always use slides and use handouts when
        necessary (i.e. if the audience will care enough to see the data that
        warrant your conclusions). If you use both a handout and a slide deck,
        include a link to the handout in a QR code in the first slide and the
        last slide (for audience members who want to view the handout during and
        after the presentation, respectively). In the slides, include very
        little text–only the main interpretation of a figure. The star of the
        show should be the figure and your verbal description of it, not the
        words on the screen.</p>

        <p>In saying all of that, I have optimized the process of creating
        presentations and the act of presenting, as well. A link to a PDF of my
        handout template can be found below;<label for="handout"
                                                   class="margin-toggle
                                                           sidenote-number"></label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="handout" class="margin-toggle" />
          <span class="sidenote">
            Note that this is basically the same as the template given in the
            <code>tufte-latex</code>
            package documentation, with some minor changes, like the font style
            used, the color of the text, etc. All credits go to the authors for
            creating this amazing and convenient resource.
