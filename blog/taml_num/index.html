	<p class="firstp">N
	<span class="firstwords">ostalgia for eras past</span>
	is a motif that returns time and time again.
	These days, people my generation (born post-2000s) romanticize the 1980s
	and 1990s and borrow their cultural revolutions to create new hybrid revivals
	with modern times. 
	One of my favorite movies, <i>Midnight in Paris</i> (2011), roots its entire plot
	in this concept, taking place both in the 2010s and the roaring twenties.
	I, for one, listen to <i>Aṉṟoru Nāḷ</i>—a Tamil song
	from the late 1960s—on rainy nights with the same admiration as my parents
	when they played it for me as a child.
	I see this everywhere, from music to movies to design.
	Why not apply the same to our usage of language?
	</p>

	<p>
	I advocate here for the revival of obsolete Tamil symbols used in the early 20ᵗʰ century, 
	working from the easy starting point of numerals.
	I may write pieces in Tamil in the future; this additionally doubles as a guide
	for anyone who reads them, in case they’re unfamiliar with the symbols.

	<h2>The Catalyst</h2>

	<p>
	I’d consider myself on the right side of the bell curve when it comes to tech-savviness.
	I try to be resourceful with my technology, finding settings that are both pleasing to the eye
	and seamlessly integrated with the handling I’m tuned to.
	</p>

	<p>
	A few months ago, I found out Apple released a new update where numerals displaying time
	on some of their devices could be customized in different scripts—namely, Arabic (Eastern),
	Arabic (Western), Bangla, Burmese, Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Khmer, Malayalam,
	Meitei, Odia, Ol Chiki, Telugu, and Urdu. 
	Kannada being my favorite language, I naturally used this opportunity <!-- TODO: nuḍigellaṁ sallada kannaḍa</i> KRM 33 -->
	to change my watchface.
	</p>

	<p>
	But one Indian language was curiously missing—Tamil.
	Perhaps it was because Tamil numerals had not been used regularly in decades,
	but that was also the case with Malayalam.
	Granted, I wouldn’t change my watchface if I had the option, but as a native speaker,
	I felt my language should also be represented.
	It seemed I <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255911703?sortBy=rank">wasn’t the only one</a> frustrated by this.
	</p>

	<p>
	As usual, I immediately got caught up in more pertinent work and forgot about this.
	</p>

	<p>
	However, I was reminded about Tamil numerals months later while on vacation in India.
	While in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Dansborg">museum in a small village</a>
	off the beaten path,
	I found an inscription detailing the installation of a flagstaff outside of the village temple
	nearly three centuries prior.
	While attempting to decode what it said, I came across not only the numerals but unique symbols
	for ‘day,’ ‘month,’ and ‘year,’ which I hadn’t seen in years.
	</p>

	<p>It read:</p>

	<blockquote>
