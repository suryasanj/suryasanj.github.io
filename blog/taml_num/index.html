	is a motif that returns time and time again.
	People my generation (born post-2000s) romanticize the 1980s
	and 1990s and borrow their cultural revolutions to create new hybrid revivals
	with modern times. 
	One of my favorite movies, <i>Midnight in Paris</i> (2011), roots its entire plot
	in this concept, showcasing nostalgia both in the 2010s and the roaring twenties.
	I, for one, listen to <i>Aṉṟoru Nāḷ</i>—a Tamil song
	from the late 1960s—on rainy nights with the same admiration as my parents
	when they played it for me as a child.
	I see this everywhere, from music to movies to design.
	Why not apply the same to our usage of language?
	</p>

	<p>
	I advocate here for the revival of obsolete Tamil symbols used in the early 20ᵗʰ century, 
	working from the easy starting point of numerals.
	I may write pieces in Tamil in the future; this additionally doubles as a guide
	for anyone who reads them, in case they’re unfamiliar with the symbols.

	<h2>Catalysts</h2>

	I consider myself tech-savvy, at least on the right side of the bell curve.
	I try to be resourceful with the devices I used, choosing settings that are both pleasing to the eye
	and seamlessly integrated with the way I use them.
	</p>

	<p>
	So, when I found that the time on Apple devices could be configured to appear
	in different scripts, I got very excited.
	Kannada being my favorite language, I naturally chose that for my watchface.<!-- TODO: nuḍigellaṁ sallada kannaḍa</i> KRM 33 -->

	<p>
	One Indian language was curiously missing—Tamil.
	Maybe it was because Tamil numerals hadn’t been used regularly in decades.
	But that was also true of Malayalam, which <i>was</i> supported.
	As a native speaker, I felt my language should alse be represented.
	And I <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255911703?sortBy=rank">wasn’t alone</a> in thinking this.
	</p>

	<p>
	Months later, I found myself
	in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Dansborg">museum</a> in a small village
	off the beaten path in southern India.
	There, off to the side, was a fairly readable inscription which I later dated to August 28ᵗʰ, 1782:<!-- TODO: explain pulli-s -->
	</p>

	<blockquote>

	<p>
	Clearly, these symbols fit well with the Tamil characters
	much better than their Latin equivalents would’ve.
	</p>

	<p>
	And, better yet, they had already been included in the 
	Unicode standard, meaning they could be typed.
