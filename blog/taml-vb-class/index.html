	<p><b>Note</b>. The contributions of this article are not entirely mine.
	A large portion of what is newly described was suggested by Dr. David McAlpin in personal communication.
	<i>Ex post facto</i>, he is a co-author of this work.</p>

      <section>
	
	<p class="firstp">T
	<span class="firstwords">amil verbs are subject to</span>
	diverse morphophonology, leading to the myriad inflectional suffixes that vary with verbal base structure.
	As such, many rule-based classification schemes have been devised, both for the learner and for the historical linguist.
	These schemes range ontologically from minimalist to maximalist.
	Minimalist schemes explain morphological diversity by reducing the number of underlying forms, grouping inflections with <i>ad hoc</i> phonological rules.
	Maximalist schemes are conservative, making little to no groupings.
	In synchronic analysis, the former tends to align, to some extent, with reconstructed suffixes in proto-stages.
	Acknowledging the various motives and ontologies in verbal classification, I construct a minimalist scheme informed by comparative data in Literary Tamil (<span style="font-variant: small-caps">lt</span>).
	</p>

	<p>
	Three competing minimalist schemes are noteworthy, described by Graul (?), Lisker (1951), and Agesthialingom (1971) (see Table §§§).
	Graul’s seven-class system groups verbs into ‘strong’ or <span style="font-variant: small-caps">p</span>-futures and ‘weak’ or <span style="font-variant: small-caps">v</span>-futures.
	The <span style="font-variant: small-caps">v</span>-futures are further divided into <span style="font-variant: small-caps">t</span>-pasts (<span style="font-variant: small-caps">i</span>), <span style="font-variant: small-caps">nt</span>-pasts (<span style="font-variant: small-caps">ii</span>), <span style="font-variant: small-caps">i</span>-pasts (<span style="font-variant: small-caps">iii</span>), and geminate-plosive pasts (<span style="font-variant: small-caps">iv</span>).
	The <span style="font-variant: small-caps">p</span>-futures, similarly, are divided into <span style="font-variant: small-caps">t</span>-pasts (<span style="font-variant: small-caps">v</span>), <span style="font-variant: small-caps">tt</span>-pasts (<span style="font-variant: small-caps">vi</span>), and <span style="font-variant: small-caps">nt</span>-pasts (<span style="font-variant: small-caps">vii</span>).
	Strong verbs take a present tense in «-kki(ṉ)ṟ-» and weak verbs in «-ki(ṉ)ṟ-».
	Lisker introduces a geminant «-<span style="font-variant: small-caps">×</span>-» which has no decided phonetic or semantic value, yet can be analyzed as a part of the base, producing ‹tt› from «×-t» and ‹pp› from «×-v».
	This reduces Graul’s classes to three.
	Agesthialingom adds a small, yet significant, modification: he proposes that the homorganic nasal-plosive pasts for lateral final verbs belong to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">nt</span>-past class.
	</p>

	<!-- TODO: construct table -->

	<p>
	From a reconstructive perspective, this is dissatisfactory.
	There is no explanation given as to why some lateral-final bases take nasal-plosive pasts («mīḷ, mīṇṭ-, mīḷv-» “return” <span style="font-variant: small-caps">dedr</span> 4883) whereas others take geminate-plosive pasts («mīḷ, mīṭṭ-, mīṭp-» “liberate” <span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span>° 4883).
	The synchronic rule ‹v› $\rightarrow$ ‹p› $/\,\{$ ṉ, ṇ $\}\,\_$ remains phonologically unmotivated.
	It’s unclear why the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">nt</span>-class is split amongst weak and strong verbs.
	Finally, there is no clear consensus as to whether Agesthialingom’s addition, simultaneously proposed by Kumaraswamy Raja, holds.
	</p>

	<p>
	My solution resolves these four issues, while providing insight into some aspects of the reconstruction of verb morphology at the Proto-Peninsular Dravidian (<span style="font-variant: small-caps">pp</span>e<span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span>r) stage.

      <section><h2>Lateral-final Bases</h2>
	
	<p>
	Sixteen verbs in the <i>Madras Tamil Lexicon</i> (<span style="font-variant: small-caps">mtl</span>) are strong lateral-final bases (see Table §§§).
	Of these, seven seem to have a backformed final (‘radical’) liquid, either from an original plosive or nasal.

	<p>
	<span style="font-variant: small-caps">d°</span> 1297 supports a final lateral for <span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span>0 exclusively in South Dravidian (<span style="font-variant: small-caps">sd</span>r), whereas both South-Central (<span style="font-variant: small-caps">scd</span>r) and Central Dravidian (<span style="font-variant: small-caps">cd</span>r) support *«kaṯ» for <span style="font-variant: small-caps">pp</span>e<span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span>r.
	Given a possible past stem *«kaṯ-ṯ-» ($\ll$ *«kaṯ-t-»), <span style="font-variant: small-caps">sd</span>r backformed a secondary base *«kal», analogizing to other verbs in this class that inherited a lateral radical.
	<span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span>4 and <span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span>15 may be combined with <span style="font-variant: small-caps">d°</span> 3031 and 5459 on similar grounds.
	<span style="font-variant: small-caps">d°</span> 3123 is compared to 3031 *«taṭ» “id.” by Emeneau and Burrow; the former only attests in Kannada, Tulu and Telugu aside from Tamil, suggesting a possible diffusive origin of Kannada to Tulu and Telugu. This would isolate radical backformation to <span style="font-variant: small-caps">sd</span>r. <!-- TODO: note weird phonology -->
	<span style="font-variant: small-caps">d°</span> 5421 only in <span style="font-variant: small-caps">sd</span>r and Telugu, and, as such, the Telugu form may be a loan. <span style="font-variant: small-caps">d°</span> 5459 *«wīṯ» “id.” attests in <span style="font-variant: small-caps">cd</span>r and <span style="font-variant: small-caps">scd</span>r and thus may be combined with 5421, representing a more conserved form. 
	</p>

	<p>
	<span style="font-variant: small-caps">d°</span> 3800 attests both «nōl» and «nōṉ» in Tamil, as well as Kannada «nōn». The Kannada form has past in «nōnt-», whose internal reconstruction would be *«nōnṯṯ-», warranting «nōṟṟ-» in Tamil. As such, the radical lateral form in Tamil may have backformed from earlier *«nōn, nōn-ṯṯ-, nōn-pp-».
	<span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span>8 is placed within an entry that has a nasal radical, with reconstructed *«(n)aṇ». <!-- note DEDR 120) -->
	Kannada «naṇṭa» “friend,” implying underlying *«naṇ-tt-an», directly parallels Tamil «naṭṭār» “friends,” which must derived from this verb.
	A similar radical backformation must have occurred for this etymon, as well, since the final lateral attests only in Tamil.
	Similar is <span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span>12, excepting having a direct past tense stem cognate elsewhere in Dravidian.
	<span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span>3 has cognates in Tulu and Gondi with a nasal radical, and Malto’s «qēɣe» may support this.
	However, the presence of a lateral radical in Kolami and Naiki makes this less likely to be a <span style="font-variant: small-caps">sd</span>r-specific backformation.
	<!-- TODO: sidenote on vēḷ -->
	</p>

	<p>
	At the same time, <span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span>13 curiously has a homophonous weak counterpart in the same <span style="font-variant: small-caps">d°</span> entry, meaning “return.”
	Although (9) has slightly different semantics, the second meaning given in <span style="font-variant: small-caps">mtl</span> (“recover, bring back”) is conceivable as an effective of “return.”
	As an affective-effective distinction is maintained by the weak-strong contract in the future and the dichotomy in past suffixes, it is conceivable that the underlying suffixes must be separated, in contrast to previous schemes.
	This may have additionally applied with <span style="font-variant: small-caps">a</span>1, <span style="font-variant: small-caps">a11</span>, and <span style="font-variant: small-caps">a15</span>, as they have both weak- and strong-stem allomorphs, suggestive of a potential archaic affective-effective distinction before later semantic leveling. <!-- TODO: comment on kil, Ta present,  and Toda -->
	</p>

	<p>
	Similarly, a much larger class of effective, strong <span style="font-variant: small-caps">tt</span>-past bases have affective, weak <span style="font-variant: small-caps">nt</span>-past counterparts, e.&VeryThinSpace;g., «vaḷar, vaḷar-nt-, vaḷar-v-» “grow (intr.)” <span style="font-variant: small-caps">d°</span> 5304 and «vaḷar, vaḷar-tt-, vaḷar-pp-» “grow (tr.)” <span style="font-variant: small-caps">d°</span> 5304.
	In parallel, I propose that weak lateral-final bases’ underlying tense suffixes are composed of «-(n)t-» in the past and «-v-» in the future, whereas strong lateral-final bases take «-tt-» and «-pp-», respectively.
	Thus, the following rules are supported: <!-- mention the parallel nasal sandhi rules -->
	</p>

	<p>
	$$
	\require{unicode}
	\left\{ \begin{aligned}\text{l, ṉ} \\ \text{ḷ, ṇ}\end{aligned} \right\} + \text{-tt-} \rightarrow 
	\left\{ \begin{aligned}\text{ṟṟ} \\ \text{ṭṭ}\end{aligned} \right\}
	$$
	</p>

	<p>
	$$
	\require{unicode}
	\left\{ \begin{aligned}\text{l, ṉ} \\ \text{ḷ, ṇ}\end{aligned} \right\} + \text{-pp-} \rightarrow 
	\left\{ \begin{aligned}\text{ṟp} \\ \text{ṭp}\end{aligned} \right\}
	$$
