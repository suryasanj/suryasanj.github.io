        <p>Below is a list of curated photos Iâ€™ve taken over the years. They
        will (most likely) all be of natural landscapes or architecture.</p>

              This came as a surprise. What seemed to be a normal bridge that we
              had to cross on our way to the train station from the Leaning
              Tower of Pisa proved to be a picture-worthy spot. Untouched by
              tourists and cars alike, it displayed an unexpected serenity.

              In spite of the many scammers trying to sell us cheap goods, the
              weird man dressed as a Subway sandwich shouting at a police officer
              in Hindi, and overpriced Italian restaurants whose food was worse
              than Olive Garden, Pisa provided some breathtaking scenery,
              especially from the top of the Leaning Tower.

              Torrential rain remained in Venice throughout the duration of my
              stay, barring any chance of a
              gondola ride. The rooms of the Dogeâ€™s Palace and the neighboring
              basilica were beautifully designed, however. I didnâ€™t realize it until
              after having left Venice, but these places seemed eerily familiar,
              given Iâ€™d just recently watched</i> Mission Impossible 7<i>.

             I landed at the Venice airport a few hours before my friends were
             to arrive, so I decided to explore the city by foot rather than
             take a water taxi to the hotel. Little did I realize that there was
             a downpour ahead of me. Nevertheless, I was amazed by the scenery,
             so much so that I took a wrong turn by walking up the steps
             of this bridge. Glad I got the view of the Grand Canal, though.

            A long, almost two-mile trek from a shady parking lot in South
            Eleuthera led us to this magnificent patch of land. It is near a
            place called
            Lighthouse Beach, and it is one of the most untouched pieces of land
            Iâ€™ve set my bare feet onâ€”reefs are just a ten-meter wade from dry
            sand. Go here soon before the reefs start to recede! Disney is building a resort here as Iâ€™m writing
            this.</i>

              The sand here is soft and a bright white color. Looking out into
              the distance, we could see what looked like either a cruise ship
              or an oil tanker. We didnâ€™t expect to see anyone else here, since
              it was Christmas day, but surprisingly about twenty people were
              walking back across the beach as we were heading over.

              This was the final attraction in the trailâ€”Lighthouse Beachâ€”a
              small cove with a steep, sandy entrance. There were a few rock
              formations on the north side of the beach, where some tide pools
              had formed. My brother and I searched for any signs of life, but
              all we could find was a large, nearly intact conch shell of a
              vibrant pink shade.

              After presenting at the SB<sup>3</sup>C Conference, a member of my
              lab and I decided to go on a short hike, and we caught a beautiful
              panoramic glimpse of Vail in the summer. What struck me the most
              about the village was how similar it looked to pictures Iâ€™d seen
              of Switzerland.

              After getting off of a one-hour bus ride from Madrid, I walked
              under the beating sun to the top of the â€˜city on the hillâ€™â€”Toledo.
              The first place we visited was the AlcÃ¡zar, or fort, where this
              picture was taken. Toledo truly looks like a city out of a fairy
              tale, but I wish it was slightly cooler when I visited; all I
              remember is the heat and dehydration from that day.
